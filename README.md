# Teamwork4R


####Coding style 
  Apply  [Google's R Style Guide](https://pages.github.com/) with a few exceptions
-use variable.name, function.name style for all Identifiers
-use classname.create for creating s3 objcet

####s3 vs s4
  Using s3. What's the point to use R instead of of using Java if you don't loose up a little bit, besides feel no need of s4.
