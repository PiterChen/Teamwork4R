# Teamwork4R


####Coding style 
  Apply to [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) with a few exceptions:
- use variable.name, function.name style for all Identifiers
- use classname.create for creating s3 objcet

####s3 vs s4
  Using s3. What's the point to use R instead of of Java/c++/Python if you don't loose up a little bit, besides feel no need of s4.
