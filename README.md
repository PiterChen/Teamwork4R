# Teamwork4R


####Coding style 
  Apply to [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) with a few exceptions:
- Use `variable.name`, `function.name` style for all identifiers.
- Use `create.classname` for creating s3 objcet.
- Prefer to put one line if-statement and one line loop-statement in one line.

####S3 vs S4
  Using S3. What's the point to use R instead of Java/C++/Python if you don't loose up a little bit, besides feel no need for S4.
