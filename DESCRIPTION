Description: The R package provides an easy-to-use method for Distributed computing.
 There are several parallel frameworks can make good use of CPU cores and GPUs of
 a computer. But we still are stuck with one computer. This package propose an 
 easy way to run R code on multiple computers in parallel. It’s easy for developers. 
 The interface is designed use S3 methodology which R developer should be familiar
 with, no complicate concepts involved. It’s easy to bring in extra computing 
 resources. To contribute computing resources, all one has to do is to run a 
 one-line script which can be stopped at any time. In another word, any one/computer
 can join and contribute at any time easily and freely. All kinds of computers are 
 welcomed, servers, office computers, personal computers, even Paspberry PI. This 
 is possible because connections between computers (nodes/clusters) are designed 
 to be weak. Damages caused by unstable network connections and unpredictable 
 behaviors of joining computers will be detected and fixed automatically.
